# Employee Register Application Frontend

This code is after a long run of failures so I wasn't sure whether I would get to publish this one here, that is the reason for the late initial commit. I've written the backend code for the program in Java Spring Boot a little while ago and have been continously trying to create a frontend code for this. I have little experience in javascript so this took a while but was able to catch up to an extend. I've also been able to learn a few things in HTML and CSS. This has been quite the experience. I am proud to have been able to come up with my own idea for the frontend website design. I have to make a few more adjustments in the backend and a lot more in frontend. Good luck  to all of that
