# Employee Register Application Frontend

This code is after a long run of failures so I wasn't sure whether I would get to publish this one here, that is the reason for the late initial commit. I've written the backend code for the program in Java Spring Boot a little while ago and have been continously trying to create a frontend code for this. I have little experience in javascript so this took a while but was able to catch up to an extend. I've also been able to learn a few things in HTML and CSS. This has been quite the experience. I am proud to have been able to come up with my own idea for the frontend website design. I have to make a few more adjustments in the backend and a lot more in frontend. Good luck  to all of that


there are ways to style the code without bringing in extra css files and instead just naming the divs with appropriate classes its called css in js libraries this might be a way to reduce the code complexity and i am gonna learn that

also i need to change the logo to an svg icon to make it more compatible with the website

```flex-direction: column``` is used to make every modules inside a div arrange one below another
